# Task 2B : Developing a Translation Model for Cross-Language Communication

In this task, our objective is to explore and create a language translation model that excels in the domain of cross-language communication and document translation. 

The baseline model provided is a strong foundation, as it involves a seq2seq model fine-tuned for translation tasks. While this model offers a good starting point, there is room for improvement through fine-tuning hyperparameters and using different architecture.

Different forms of experimentation and architectural model building are encouranged irrelevant of the performance of the model. Novel Ideation or Smart Experimentaion is highly appreciated.
