# Task 2D: Designing Your Machine Learning System

Welcome to Task 2D of the Intelligence SIG Recruitments 2023! This is an exciting and open-ended design question that builds upon the knowledge and skills you've gained from Task 2A, 2B, and 2C. In this task, you'll be challenged to design a machine learning system that takes questions in English and provides answers in French.

## Task Overview

This task is the culmination of your journey through Task 2A, 2B, and 2C. It's an opportunity for you to put your machine learning and natural language processing skills to the test. Your objective is to design a system that can intelligently understand English questions and generate accurate, contextually relevant answers in French, similar to the Question and Answering that you did in Task 2C.

## Task Specifics

- **Understanding the Problem:** Before you dive into designing the system, it's crucial to have a good understanding of the problem statement. Review the tasks from 2A to 2C and the resources provided to form a solid foundation.

- **Incorporate Knowledge:** Task 2D is where you bring together everything you've learned. You can use the word embeddings created in Task 2A, explore machine translation techniques from Task 2B, and implement question-answering systems from Task 2C. This is where the magic happens.

- **Open-Ended Design:** This is a design question, meaning there's no one "correct" answer. You have the creative freedom to design your machine learning system the way you see fit. Explain your design choices and the reasoning behind them in detail. The more creative the better!

- **Documentation:** Your README should be well-structured and include explanations of your system's architecture, algorithms, models, and any other components. Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to use and evaluate your system. Please keep the documentation concise and in bullet points, we don't want bloated ChatGPT text.

- **Demonstration:** Consider providing examples of how your system performs, including sample English questions and their corresponding French answers.

- **Balancing Theory and Implementation:** While the focus is on design, a good design should be well-informed by theory and practically implementable. Strike a balance between the two.

## Questions and Support

If you have any questions, need clarifications, or encounter challenges, feel free to reach out to the group. We encourage active discussion and knowledge-sharing among the participants.

## Submission

When you're ready to submit your solution for Task 2D, make sure to include all relevant documentation and code. Organize your repository to make it easy for reviewers to understand your design and implementations. You can submit multiple times and make improvements to your system as time progresses. You can have multiple systems as well! Feel free to try out everything! Don't wait until the last minute to start this task. Give yourself ample time to explore, design, implement, and document your system. 

Good luck, and enjoy the journey of designing your own machine learning system! 🚀
